# Description
This is a Unity city car driving simulator. <br>
Initially, a city map is exported from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). Then it is imported in Trian3D builder software where you can modify your map, delete some unnecessary features of the map. After that, the map is imported as FBX in unity. I used RealisticCarController Unity asset for setting a car in a scene.
